A node can be a unique desktop computer connected to the Internet. It can also be a virtual-private server (VPS) that is rented or purchased, and which the developer can access at will. Or, it can be another type of unique instance of a computational machine.</p></div> <h3 id="basic-info-for-connecting-at-least-two-nodes"><a href="#basic-info-for-connecting-at-least-two-nodes" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Basic Info for Connecting At Least Two Nodes</h3> <p>If you are ready to press forward with your first test asset chain, some basic knowledge about how to connect two nodes is recommended for the initial setup.</p> <p>As per the original blockchain designs of Satoshi Nakamoto, on which Komodo is based, a Komodo asset chain does not exist on a single node. Rather, it exists via a connection between two or more nodes. This is the nature of decentralization: it is on the network we rely, rather than a single authority. Therefore, the design of the technology requires you to have two separate nodes, which are able to connect over a network.</p> <p>In the most ideal circumstance, the new Komodo developer will already have two virtual private servers (VPS's) available for testing. VPS's can be cheap and easy to manage. A typical VPS will either have a static external IP or can be assigned one; this makes it simple to create a connection between the two VPS nodes.</p> <p>If the new developer does not have two VPS's available, setting up a test asset chain on two local machines in a home or office-type setting is still achievable, but it may require a little more troubleshooting.</p> <p>If using a home or office-type setup, the challenge lies in the way the network is created, and there are myriad network setups.</p> <p>For example, if the developers are operating on a local router, where the two machines are connected via wi-fi, the local ip addresses of the machines are harder to find. This is because the router assigns new local ip addresses to the machines each time they re-connect to the router. It is not possible to see the ip addresses from the Internet. In this situation, the developer must log into the router's software interface and search for the currently assigned local ip addresses.</p> <p>A home or office-type setup can suffice, if you're just looking to test an asset chain quickly and don't want to spend money on a VPS. However, don't be surprised if you need to ask for help. Please reach out to us, and we'll help the best we can.</p> <p>You will know that your machines have successfully connected when you can run the following command in the terminal of one of your machines:</p> <p><code>ping &lt;insert ip address of your other machine here&gt;</code></p> <p>This command will generate a response every second, indicating the <code>ping</code> speed with which your machines are able to connect.</p> <div class="language-bash extra-class"><pre class="language-bash"><code>$ <span class="token function">ping</span> 192.168.1.101

The first comes from the cost of making records in your asset chain's database, and in the records of the KMD main chain. These records are called &quot;notarizations.&quot;</p> <p>Notarizations are performed as transactions on your blockchain and on the main KMD blockchain. The transactions have messages included inside that indicate the most recent and secure state of your asset chain. Your Komodo asset chain will know how to recognize and rely on notarizations automatically.</p> <p>Every ten to twenty minutes, our notary nodes will hash the history of your asset chain and insert it as a record into the KMD main chain. This provides an initial layer of security, but it is not the final layer.</p> <p>In another ten to twenty minutes, all of the information in the KMD chain (including your asset chain's hashed data) is hashed and inserted into the BTC blockchain. Once your information is pushed into BTC, your asset chain will consider all notarized information effectively settled and immutable; only the recent, un-notarized transactions are still relying on your asset chain's raw consensus mechanism. <a href="/komodo-docs-vuepress/basic-docs/installations/asset-chain-parameters.html#ac-staked">Click here to learn more about the types of consensus mechanisms you can choose on a KMD asset chain</a>.</p> <p>Thus, your asset chain will have all the power of Bitcoin securing your blockchain's history, with the zero-knowledge privacy of the Zcash parameters pre-installed, and all of the interoperability, scalability, and more that Komodo adds to your development experience.</p> <p>As the notarizations are transactions, they naturally have a cost, and this cost is covered by you, the asset-chain developer. Over the course of a year, assuming consistent activity, the cost for performing these transactions is 365 KMD, and also 365 of your asset chain's coins.</p> <p>The second part of the cost of notarization is the payment to the actual Komodo team, which is given in exchange for our services. You may reach out to our third-party service providers to receive a quote. @siu (Discord: @siu#3920) is the head of ChainMakers, and @PTYX (Discord: @PTYX#6840) is the head of Chainzilla. Both can provide different levels of service in asset-chain creation, electrum-server (SPV) setup and maintenance, explorer setup, and other decentralized-technology services.</p> <p>Several teams have already signed up for our services and are developing on our platform. From our experience with them we can confidently say that our pricing is competitive compared to other blockchain services. Furthermore, when considering that a Komodo-based asset chain does not require KMD for gas and transaction fees, the cost to your end-users can be exponentially cheaper. All things considered, creating a fully independent blockchain on Komodo can cost but a small fraction of what it would cost to deploy a single smart contract on the platforms of some of our competitors.</p> <h3 id="a-note-about-low-activity-blockchains"><a href="#a-note-about-low-activity-blockchains" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> A Note About Low-Activity Blockchains</h3> <p>The Komodo security system, dPoW, functions best for asset chains that are being actively used. If there is an end-user performing a transaction every minute on average, dPoW should function as normal. This includes hashing the asset chain's most recent state and inserting it into the KMD blockchain every ten to twenty minutes on average (and from there, a hash protecting this data is soon pushed into the Bitcoin blockchain).</p> <p>Many blockchains will not be used on a regular basis, however. The developers also may not elect to have any block rewards that would act as an incentive for miners to maintain activity on the chain.</p> <p>It is not economically efficient to notarize every single block that occurs. Therefore Komodo's dPoW security system requires several blocks to be generated before a notarization takes place. Without activity or miners, the notarization process naturally will stall.</p> <p>This creates a situation which is easily remedied, but only if the developer is proactive to maintain activity on their chain. We advise asset-chain developers who do not expect frequent transaction volume to ensure activity at crucial moments. If a transaction occurs on the blockchain from an end-user, for which notarization security is required, a simple solution can be to have a node running a script to watch for such transactions. When the transaction enters the mempool, the node can perform minimum-amount transactions until the end-user's transaction is notarized, and then the script can cease activity.</p> <p>The amount it costs the developer to perform these occasional minimum-amount transactions is far cheaper than it would cost the developer to have the asset chain notarized every ten to twenty minutes on an inactive chain.</p></div> <div class="page-edit"><!----> <div class="last-updated"><span class="prefix">Last Updated: </span> <span class="time">12/5/2018, 12:38:06 AM</span></div></div> <div class="page-nav"><p class="inner"><span class="prev">
