# Start Here

For the developer wishing to build your own Blockchain using Komodo's software we recommend the following approach.

### Assumptions for this Documentation

Before we get into specifics, we need to cover a few assumptions we make about our readers.

We're going to start by assuming that you have a general idea of what a Blockchain is.

If you're not familiar, we recommend that you [read Part I of our white paper](https://www.komodoplatform.com/whitepaper). It explains what a Blockchain is, why Blockchain technology is significant, the basic idea of how it works, and why you should care.

We're also going to assume that you are comfortable programming in at least one mainstream language. Technically, Komodo can work with any language, but there are some things to keep in mind before you get too excited. [Find out more about languages on Komodo here](../start-here/outline-for-new-developers.html#a-brief-note-about-languages).

If you're not yet a programmer, but you're interested to make a career in the Blockchain revolution, welcome! The open-source nature of Komodo and our enthusiastic community make this a perfect place to begin your journey. We recommend that you come [to our Discord channel](https://komodoplatform.com/discord) and discuss your goals with our community members. We look forward to meeting you!

## "Why Komodo?"

### The Basic Concept of Komodo

A Komodo-based Blockchain, called an "asset chain", is a fully independent Blockchain that is forked from Komodo technology and has the option of using Komodo's many services, including Komodo's [security](../installations/creating-asset-chains.html#secure-this-asset-chain-with-delayed-proof-of-work) and scalability.

We use the term, "asset chain," because the coins in the Blockchain are assets owned by you and your Blockchain's users.

Komodo's unique combination of technology grants businesses and developers an increased level of freedom.

### Using Komodo, You and Your Users Get an Independent Blockchain

There are many advantages to using the Komodo framework over other Blockchain platforms.

One important thing to point out is that, at this time, a Komodo-based asset chain is unlike anything else currently available on the Blockchain market.

Most other Blockchain platforms run a layer-one Blockchain; the journeyman developer runs their smart-contract code in a virtual machine, or on a side chain, which runs on top of the layer-one chain. The developer's assets are not full Blockchain coins, but rather only tokens, also called colored coins, that are bound to the limitations of the parent chain. In many circumstances, your end-users pay gas and transaction fees in the coin of the layer-one chain, regardless of your end-users' objectives.

Lets compare a Blockchain platform to a vehicle. With those other Blockchain platforms, it is as though you are paying to ride in their car, you pay a very high price for that seat, and your end-users have to sit in your lap.

In Komodo, you get the whole car all to yourself. Add any features you want, change whatever you like, and even import the open-source designs from other Blockchain ecosystems.

All that is required is that you keep the basic Komodo Blockchain framework in place, as it facilitates your connection to [the security of the Bitcoin hash rate](../installations/creating-asset-chains.html#secure-this-asset-chain-with-delayed-proof-of-work) that we provide, and also your connection to other Komodo asset chains and features.

### No Gas/Transaction Fees

Unlike other Blockchain platforms, on Komodo your end-users do not have to pay gas/transaction fees in KMD for each transaction. Instead, you get to decide what is required, and we feature many tools to facilitate your approach.

### Limitless Scalability On Demand

Because your asset chain is its own independent Blockchain, your scalability is limitless and is not affected by activity elsewhere in the Komodo ecosystem.

If another asset chain in the Komodo ecosystem has a sudden surge of activity, your asset chain does not slow down at all, as you are both on entirely separate Blockchains.

On the other hand, if activity on your asset chain hits an extremely high rate and causes your chain to have transaction backlog, you can replicate your Blockchain into two linked Blockchains. Using this method, we have already proved that the Komodo ecosystem can run more than 40,000 transactions per second, and we are prepared to scale to 1,000,000 tx/sec and beyond.

Your creativity is not limited by the mathematical constraints that affect other Blockchain platforms, but instead only by hardware and your imagination.

If you want to write the first Uber-like dApp, Komodo is the platform for you.

### Interoperability is a Cinch

Because our initial concept was to create a network of secure independent Blockchains, we designed our network from the ground-up for interoperability.

For example, you can run as many asset chains as you want, and through our cross-chain burn protocol, you can burn coins or tokens on one asset chain and have them show up on another.

Or, maybe you want to write a smart contract that coordinates with a business partner's asset chain? Not a problem. Our technology allows you to monitor and update your chain's state and smart contracts using SPV technology to make observations of other asset chains and participating third-party Blockchains.

What if you want to trade value directly with Blockchains outside the Komodo ecosystem? We've got you covered. With our atomic-swap powered decentralized exchange, BarterDEX, you can swap coins with any Blockchain that is based on either the Bitcoin or Ethereum . We also have smart-contract technology that allows you to build decentralized gateways or bridges to other Blockchain networks of your choice.

### Built-in Zero-knowledge Privacy

Many Blockchain platforms say they'll have privacy some day, but how and when they'll get there remains a mystery.

In Komodo, we knew privacy would be an essential feature for any developer with a good head on their shoulders. That's why we started our platform as a fork of [Zcash](https://z.cash) (which is itself a fork of [Bitcoin](https://bitcoin.org)).

This allows us to provide built-in zero-knowledge (zk-snark) technology, which is a special kind of privacy tech. Other types of privacy typically only attempt to hide your trail by blending your transaction history with other users'. Those other types of privacy can protect you for some time, but not forever. Because your blended data is present in the public domain, as quantum-computing technology advances it will likely be able to unravel your currency trail -- and your privacy.

Zero-knowledge technology is much stronger. It moves your coins from one address to another with no data leftover in the public domain for later analysis. The way it works inside the Blockchain engine is pretty complicated, but lucky for you, you don't have to worry about how it works. Just read Part IV of our [whitepaper](https://komodoplatform.com/whitepaper) to make sure you fully understand the pros and cons of this privacy method, and then dive right in, using our built-in API commands.

Every Blockchain created using Komodo has zero-knowledge privacy pre-installed, giving you the tools to protect both yourself and your end-users from people who just don't know how to mind their own business.

### Your Blockchain's Engine Belongs to You

Having a Blockchain all to yourself grants a competitive level of freedom to your creative endeavors.

The highly advanced developer that wishes to engineer your own consensus mechanism can move forward rapidly with your ideas, backed up with the hash rate of Bitcoin. You also have our consensus-level smart contract technology at your disposal, which can allow you to make adjustments to your consensus mechanism far more quickly.

Unlike other platforms, there is no need to wait for the Komodo team to update either the default daemon's functionality, or to update the main Komodo Blockchain (KMD).

So long as we can audit and verify your changes before we pull them into our dPoW architecture (Notary Nodes), you are able to develop at will.

Keep in mind, however, there are costs associated with integrating a Blockchain into the notary network.

### Discover What Others Create

On the other hand, a developer that does not wish to be a core Blockchain engineer, but rather to spend their energy only on building decentralized applications (dApps), also receives benefits.

When an advanced Blockchain engineer in the ecosystem creates a useful new concept or template on their own asset chain, they can choose to contribute this code to the default Komodo daemon.

Once accepted by the Komodo team, this functionality is then available to all developers throughout the ecosystem.

For example, one of the Blockchains in our ecosystem, Verus, recently solved the Nothing-At-Stake problem that has long plagued Proof-of-Stake Blockchains. They generously share their code with the rest of the ecosystem, and Verus Proof of Stake will be available through the default Komodo daemon for use by other projects in the Eco-system soon.

### Software Updates to the Daemon are Free

If there's one thing we've learned since we made our first atomic-swap in 2014, it's that Blockchain technology is growing faster than any one person can possibly keep up.

There are many questions the Blockchain industry faces over the next several decades. How will we approach encryption in the age of quantum computing? What will miners do as Bitcoin's block rewards decrease? How will software adapt to government interests?

The good news for you is that our team does a good chunk of the work for you. You freely receive the updates we create for your asset chain's daemon. This helps to keep your Blockchain up-to-speed with many of the latest technologies.

### The Komodo Declaration of Independence

What if, someday, you decide you want to move elsewhere? We would be sad to see you go, but the freedom to leave is perhaps the most essential piece of Komodo's design. In fact, [read our history](https://komodoplatform.com/komodo-platform-a-commitment-to-innovation/), and you'll discover that this freedom is the reason why our platform exists in the first place.

Since your asset chain is a fully independent Blockchain, there's no need go through the mess of manually transferring end-users' ERC20 tokens into a new Blockchain or any other cumbersome departure. You can free to stop accepting updates from the upstream Komodo source or discontinue the dPoW security service at any time and you and your end-users can head off into the great beyond.

### Many More Advantages to Discover

These are just a few (of many!) advantages that Komodo offers to our ecosystem developers.

If you want a deep dive into how the tech works, [check out our full white paper here](https://www.komodoplatform.com/whitepaper).

### A Caveat for Daemon and Smart-Contract Developers

There is one caveat. Under most circumstances, only a highly skilled developer should make adjustments to the code that affects the internal workings of the default daemon. This caveat includes creating smart-contract templates using our technology.

For this reason, at this time our team is available to assist developers in writing smart-contract templates -- both those who wish to work outside the daemon and those who wish to work within it.

If you have an idea that you would like to make a reality on Komodo and you need assistance in writing a secure smart-contract template, please reach out to us. We are actively working to build up our library of smart-contract templates, and will therefore do what we can to help you safely code your smart-contract idea and add it to your daemon.

This offer is only available for a limited time, and only on an "as is" basis.

Over time, as the library of secure smart-contract templates increases, it is possible that the need to create new smart-contract templates will decrease. We also hope that a community of advanced smart-contract freelance developers will grow in our ecosystem, to facilitate Komodo's adoption.

### The Cost of Running an Asset Chain

Simply creating and developing the asset chain for testing purposes does not require contact with or payment to the Komodo Network.

::: warning IMPORTANT
However, in nearly all circumstances, an asset chain is only secure once it receives our dPoW connection to the Bitcoin hash rate (dPoW).
:::

You can read more about how the security and payment are structured in [the section on Komodo's dPoW security services](../installations/creating-asset-chains.html#secure-this-asset-chain-with-delayed-proof-of-work).

In general, the cost for Komodo's security services is competitive. While the initial setup cost may or may not be higher than other Blockchain platforms, the benefits that come from owning your own full Blockchain, not having to pay gas/transaction fees in any other coin, and in being able to deploy unlimited smart contracts and ERC20-like tokens on your chain; can become a cost-saving advantage over time for both you and your end-users.

Please reach out to our team whenever you are ready to enable dPoW for your Blockchain. We will direct you to one of our service providers, and they can give you a direct quote for the annual cost.

::: tip
We have a limited number of early-adopter discounts. Please inquire while the offer lasts.
:::

### A Brief Note About Languages

In considering the languages available in the Komodo ecosystem, there are two aspects to address: code that runs inside your daemon, and code that runs outside of it.

Code that runs inside the daemon is typically low-level, and working with this code requires strong experience. This low-level code may, for example, change the nature of your consensus mechanism, or provide a foundational smart-contract template that can be called from outside the daemon to be used in a dApp.

Code that runs outside the daemon can be high-level. A dApp that is built on existing smart-contract templates can exist entirely outside the daemon. It could consist of GUI's, back-end databases, and other non-daemon code and assets that make your dApp function.

In both circumstances, you are able to use whatever language you desire.

However, if you are working within the daemon, we currently recommend that you have a considerable amount of programming experience, and that you work primarily in C/C++. These are the native languages of the Komodo daemon. When making adjustments to your coin's daemon, other languages can be supported, depending on the circumstances. Please reach out to our team with your questions.

For anything that occurs outside of the daemon, naturally you may use any language that can send an rpc call to your coin's daemon. Most common languages support this functionality. We are in the process of creating wrappers in various languages for importing Komodo's RPC functionality into your workflow. If you are using a language that is not yet available, we welcome you to create a wrapper and contribute it to [our Github repository](https://www.github.com/komodoplatform). Please reach out to us with your language-wrapper requests.

## Install the Basic Komodo Software

So you've decided you want to take Komodo for a free test drive. Alright!

The next step is to install the software on your machine.

[Follow through the instructions here,](../installations/basic-instructions.html#installing-basic-komodo-software) and return to this spot in the outline when you are finished.

## Get Familiar With komodod and komodo-cli

Now that you have `komodod` and `komodo-cli` installed, [skim briefly through the instructions on how to interact with a Komodo-based daemon, linked here](../installations/basic-instructions.html#interacting-with-komodo-chains).

You'll come back to this section later, once you're ready to execute rpc calls, API commands, and runtime parameters.

::: tip
You do not need to launch or sync the main Komodo chain (KMD), and you do not need to own any KMD to test an asset chain.
:::

## Create Your First Asset Chain

With `komodod` and `komodo-cli` installed you're ready to spin up an asset chain.

[Follow the instructions in this linked guide to build your first asset chain.](../installations/creating-asset-chains.html#creating-a-new-asset-chain)

We recommend that you use the simplest of settings for now.

For example:

`./komodod -ac_name=HELLOWORLD -ac_supply=777777 &`

## Execute Elementary RPC Calls

After you have your asset chain running on both nodes, we recommend executing some basic rpc calls in the terminal.

Here are links to some simple and common rpc examples:

[`getnewaddress`](../essential-rpc/wallet.html#getnewaddress)

[`sendtoaddress`](../essential-rpc/wallet.html#sendtoaddress)

[`getinfo`](../essential-rpc/control.html#getinfo)

As Komodo is downstream from both [Bitcoin](https://bitcoin.org) and [Zcash](https://z.cash), essentially all of the commands that are available on those two upstream Blockchains are also available here.

## Test Out Platform-Specific Features

We create many features, functionalities, and commands that are specifically designed for dApp and platform-oriented developers.

For example, you can learn how to make asset chains that are more complicated in nature.

[Read this documentation first to get the basic idea](../installations/asset-chain-parameters.html).

Once you understand the concept, you can test a few asset-chain tricks -- like making your asset chain's consensus mechanism [a mix between Proof of Work and Proof of Stake](../installations/asset-chain-parameters.html#ac-staked).

Or, you could make your asset chain suitable for a rapid mining period, followed by complete Blockchain disposal. Use parameters such as [`ac_end`](../installations/asset-chain-parameters.html#ac-end), [`ac_reward`](../installations/asset-chain-parameters.html#ac-reward), [`ac_decay`](../installations/asset-chain-parameters.html#ac-decay), and [`ac_perc`](../installations/asset-chain-parameters.html#ac-perc) for this effect.

## Discover CC Smart Contracts

Now you should be ready to head into smart contract territory.

Smart contracts on Komodo are a bit different (and if you ask us, a bit better too, but we're admittedly biased).

If you need to catch the general idea, read the section, [Smart Contract Overview](cc-overview.html).

First, you must create an asset chain that has the [ac_cc runtime parameter properly enabled](../installations/asset-chain-parameters.html#ac-cc).

With this activated, you can try a few existing templates:

- [Create ERC20 tokens on your new asset chain](../cryptoconditions/cc-tokens.html)
- Try using your [built-in on-chain DEX](../cryptoconditions/cc-gateways.html)
- Use [the oracles smart-contract template](../cryptoconditions/cc-oracles.html) to import real-world data to your Blockchain, which can then affect Blockchain behavior

...and more!

## Write Your Own Smart-Contract Templates

If you're ready to try writing your own customized smart-contract template, please read the detailed technical documentation written by our lead developer, JL777: [Mastering Crypto Conditions](https://docs.komodoplatform.com/cc/index-book-jl.html).

Most developers don't need to design smart contracts on Komodo, but rather, only need to implement existing smart-contracts templates while developing a dApp. So don't be discouraged if the technical documentation appears too thick for your level of experience. Come to Discord when you have questions.
